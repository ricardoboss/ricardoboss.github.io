He said they didn't do developer-focused PC building guides, because they don't know the requirements. I wanted to write something about what hardware is needed by software developers.","createdAt":"2020-07-05T08:00:00.000Z","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A software developer doesn't need a high-end rig.\nTo develop software, something less powerful than a normal office computer is required."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"what-software-do-software-developers-use"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What software do software developers use?"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In general, most software developers use some kind of "},{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"text editor"}]},{"type":"text","value":" and/or "},{"type":"element","tag":"abbr","props":{"title":"Integrated Development Environment"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"IDE"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":" to write code.\nIf it's a normal text editor, then a "},{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"terminal/shell"}]},{"type":"text","value":" is often required too.\nThis is because most software needs to be compiled, i.e. translated to machine-readable instructions, by a "},{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"compiler"}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It also comes down to which "},{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"operating system"}]},{"type":"text","value":" the developer is using.\nMacOS obviously only runs on Apple hardware, which makes this post irrelevant (unless you are into that hackintosh-stuff).\nWindows is great if the developer also requires a lot of office-related software or is bound to it because of some office policy.\nUnix-based operating systems are more suitable for the advanced software developers, or those who are looking for more privacy."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The software mentioned above doesn't need the strongest hardware to run.\nMore powerful hardware may lead to faster compile times or faster incremental builds for debugging, which in turn saves the developer time while developing the software."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And last, but not least, the hardware should be able to run on the development machine for debugging.\nThis can also happen in a virtual machine, but this introduces performance impacts and may require even more powerful hardware and disk space."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Speaking of disk space: how much disk space does a software developer need in 2020?\nShort answer: less than you'd think.
