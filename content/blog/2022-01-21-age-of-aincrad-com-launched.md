## Party-Time!

On saturday, the 15th of January 2022, we officially launched [age-of-aincrad.com]!

After about one year of working in my free time on the site and another one of delay it is finally out in the open.
As with every new project, it was very pleasant to choose which frameworks to use and figuring out how back- and frontend communicate and so on.

Speaking of, here are some technical details about the new website:

- Frontend: [Vuetify]/[Vue.js]
- Backend: [Strapi]
- Webserver/Reverse-Proxy: [Nginx]
- Host: Ubuntu

In the future, I will add more updates about the new website and the development process.
