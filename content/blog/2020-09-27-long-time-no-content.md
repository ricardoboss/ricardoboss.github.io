  I haven't taken advantage of my new blog system yet. These are some topics I find interesting and will maybe write something about in the future.

Hi there! As one can obviously see, I haven't created any posts in the last two months.
And to be honest, the first two posts where only there to test my new website.

With this small update, I want to give the reader a bit of insight on what topics I find interesting and what could be a topic for fully fledged blog post in the future.

> These are topics which I will most likely be writing about in the future. No guarantees.

- Laravel (PHP Framework)
- Minecraft Server Plugins (Java)
- CI/CD (GitLab and Github)
- Raspberry PI as a .NET Core runtime target
- Games (probs Rocket League and/or Factorio)

That's it for now. If you want me to write something about a certain topic, hit me up on Twitter ([@\_ricardoboss](https://twitter.com/_ricardoboss)).
