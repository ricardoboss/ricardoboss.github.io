    The new website of Age of Aincrad finally launched.
---

## Party-Time!

On saturday, the 15th of January 2022, we officially launched [age-of-aincrad.com]!

After about one year of working in my free time on the site and another one of delay (I'll get into this later) it is finally out in the open.
As with every new project, it was very pleasant to choose which frameworks to use and figuring out how back- and frontend communicate and so on.

Speaking of, here are some technical details about the new website:

- Frontend: [Vuetify]/[Vue.js]
- Backend: [Strapi]
- Webserver/Reverse-Proxy: [Nginx]
- Host: Ubuntu

## History

What goes into preparing a website project for publishing?
Here are some key takeaways I learned on the way.

### Keep track of configs

Some time into any project, you'll want to preview your work.
Be it to a coworker, a manager or someone else.
